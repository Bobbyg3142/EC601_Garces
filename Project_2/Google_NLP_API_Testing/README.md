# Google Natural Language API Testing
For Phase 1b I tested 2 programs related to the Google NLP API:

(1) Sentiment Analysis: Given a string of text analyze the overall sentiment of the message (is the message positive or negative?

(2) Entity Analysis: Given a string of text find the proper nouns (such as cities, names, addresses, etc) and determine how relevvant it is to the message.

Next Steps:

---> Learn how to import a text file to automatically give the NLP API a string of text to analyze

---> Update program to parse a large text file into individual sentences and return a sentiment score per sentence, rather than for entire text file.

---> Tweek program to only care about stock mentions
