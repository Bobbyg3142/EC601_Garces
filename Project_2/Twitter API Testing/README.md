# Twitter API Testing
For Phase 1a I tested 3 programs related to the twitter API:

(1) pull any users information such as account creation date, username, time since last tweet, etc

(2) get recent tweets from a user, the exact timeframe can be selected

(3) count the number of recent tweets from a user. timeframe can be selected

Next Steps: 

---> Learn how to gather tweets from a specific hashtags

---> Find most popular users related to stock trading and investing

---> Continue experimenting with filtering techniques

---> Determine how to export tweet and comment information into a format that can be used by the NLP API
